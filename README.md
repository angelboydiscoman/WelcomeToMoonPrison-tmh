# Welcome to Moon Prison
___
A text-based game playable in a web browser, written in Javascript for The Minute Hour.

## To test:
Download the folder and run index.html in a web browser, you will probably have to use a local server.
Using npm:

  `npm install http-server -g`
  
  `http-server . -p 8000`

## Development status:
It is in extremely early stages. There are likely ugly or nonsensical patches of code as I have not had much experience with Javascript yet. Feel free to be as critical as possible as I need as many problems as possible to tackle so I can to learn quicker.

Should someone feel they should take over, feeling better equipped to handle the project and seeing the tradgedy of my coding, feel free to mention this.
